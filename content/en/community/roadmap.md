The Jenkins X roadmap can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-x/projects/23/views/1).

Please join our [TOC meetings](https://jenkins-x.io/community/) and [Slack channels](/community/#slack) to ask questions and drive input on the future of the project! The best way to get a change into Jenkins X is to write a pull request with the change to the appropriete. If a change requires changes to multiple repositories you should start with creating a PR in the [Jenkins X enhancements repo](https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements) documenting the propsed change.
