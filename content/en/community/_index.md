Welcome to the Jenkins X community!

We value respect and inclusiveness and follow the [CDF Code of Conduct](/community/code_of_conduct/) in all interactions.

### Slack

We'd love to talk with you about Jenkins X and are happy to help if you have any questions.

Talk to us on our slack channels, which are part of the Kubernetes slack.
Join Kubernetes slack [here](https://slack.k8s.io/) and find us on our channels:

- [\#jenkins-x-user](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C9MBGQJRH) for users of Jenkins X
- [\#jenkins-x-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C9LTHT2BB) for developers of Jenkins X

### Meetings

<!--
During office hours we demo the latest features, answer questions, and share knowledge together.

We meet for office hours **every other Tuesday** at 15:00 UTC (_See your timezone [here](https://time.is/1500_in_UTC)_).
